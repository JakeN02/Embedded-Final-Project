# Embedded-Final-Project
Electronic variable gas valve created by Jake Nachsin and Joseph Giannini
The file to run is called main.c
Could not achieve full functionality with ADC values, used assistance from AI tools and help from other students to write code that has limited functionality and attempts to work without temperature values, used a peer's code for board verification
The code attempts to check for a call for heat signal and then runs the ingition sequence to change the LED state, and open the solenoid and main valve.
